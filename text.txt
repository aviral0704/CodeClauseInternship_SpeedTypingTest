Insofar as the novel may be said to have a plot,
it follows the fortunes of Christopher Glowry, a
morose widower who lives with his only son
Scythrop in the isolated family mansion, Nightmare
Abbey, in Lincolnshire. Mr Glowry's melancholy leads
him to choose servants with long faces or dismal names
such as Mattocks, Graves and Skellet. The few visitors
he welcomes to his home are mostly of a similar cast of
mind, with the sole exception of his brother-in-law,
Mr Hilary. The visitors engage in conversations, or
occasionally monologues, which serve to highlight their
eccentricities or obsessions. There is a brief interruption
to the usual round of life at the Abbey when the misanthropic
poet, Mr Cypress, pays a farewell visit before going into exile.
After his departure, there are reports of a ghost stalking the
building, and the appearance of a ghastly figure in the library
throws the guests into consternation. Only later is the apparition
revealed to have been Mr Glowry's somnambulant steward Crow.
